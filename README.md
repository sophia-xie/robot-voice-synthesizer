# Robot Voice Synthesizer

"*Barbie has a great day every day, but Ken only has a great day if Barbie looks at him.*" --Barbie (film), 2023

This project, submitted in *BME 252: Linear Signals and Systems*, leverages spectral analysis, filter design, and sampling theory to make human voices sounds like a retro sci-fi robot.

Written in a Python Jupyter Notebook, it uses packages `NumPy`, `Matplotlib`, and `SciPy` to perform Fourier transforms and signal processing.

Credit to my classmates, Gloria So and Agam Soni, for testing different parameters to optimize the quality of the output.
